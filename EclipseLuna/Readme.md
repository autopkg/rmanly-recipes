This doesn't work.

Anytime eclipse is deployed via munki I get the error:

>You can't open the application "Eclipse"  
>because it is not supported on this type  
>of mac.  

This occurs whether I attempt to use the munki recipe here or just munkiimport the pkg from sheagcraig's pkg recipe.

I'm about to give up for the day.
